# Ohara Manager

This repository contains Ohara manager itself (an HTTP server built with node.js) and Ohara manager client (Ohara fastdata UIs built with React.js ). In the following docs, we refer **Server** as Ohara manager and **Client** as Ohara manager client.

## Initial machine setup

1.  Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 8.10.0 or greater.

2.  Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) 1.7.0. (Note that you must install the exact version of yarn **1.7.0** as listed here or the **yarn.lock** file in Ohara manager could change when building on different machines)

3.  Make sure you're in the ohara-manager root and use this command to setup the app: `yarn setup`. This will install all the dependencies for both the **Server** and the **Client** as well as creating a production build for the client.

4.  Install forever via npm, **this step is optional**
    ```sh
    npm install -g forever
    ```

Have issues while setting up? Try the **Having issues** section to troubleshoot.

## Development

**If this is your first time running this project, you need to complete the _Initial machine setup_ section above** ðŸ‘†

You need to start both **Server** and **Client** servers before you can start your development. Follow the instructions below:

**Server:**

Make sure you're in the ohara-manager root and start the server with:

```sh
yarn start
```

You can start the server and set the configurator API like this:

```sh
CONFIGURATOR_API=http://localhost:1000/v0 yarn start
```

> Double check the configurator spelling and the API url

After starting the server, visit `http://localhost:5050` in your browser.

**Client**:

Make you're in the **client** directory and start the dev server with:

```sh
yarn start
```

After starting the dev server, visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Test

You can run all tests including **Server** and **Client** unit tests as well as **Client** End-to-End test with a single npm script:

> Note that this command won't generate test reports for you

```sh
yarn test:all
```

**Server:**

Make sure you're in the ohara-manager root, and use the following commands:

Run the test

```sh
yarn test
```

Run the test and stay in Jest watch mode, **this is usually what you want to do when developing:**

```sh
yarn test:watch
```

Generate a test coverage report

> The coverage reports can be found in `ohara-manager/client/coverage/`

```sh
yarn test:coverage
```

**Client:**

Make sure you're in the **client** directory, and use the following commands:

Run the tests and stay in Jest watch mode

```sh
yarn test:watch # or simply yarn:test
```

Generate test coverage reports

> The coverage reports can be found in `ohara-manager/client/coverage/`

```sh
yarn test:coverage
```

**Client** also has End-to-End tests, you can run them via the following command:

```sh
yarn cypress
```

This will open cypress test runner, you can then run your test manually through the UIs.

## Linting

We use [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) to ensure our code quality:

**Server:**

```sh
yarn lint
```

It's usually helpful to run linting while developing, that's why we also provide a npm script to do so:

```sh
yarn dev
```

This will start the server with `nodemon` and run the linting script whenever nodemon reloads.

**Client:**

Since our client is bootstrapped with create-react-app, so the linting part is already taken care. When starting the **Client** dev server with `yarn start`, the linting will be starting automatically.

## Format

We use [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to format our code. You can format all `.js` files with:

```sh
yarn format
```

- You can ignore files or folders when running `yarn format` by editing the `.prettierignore` in the Ohara-manager root.

> Note that `node_modules` is ignore by default so you don't need to add that in the `.prettierignore`

## Build

**Note that this step is only required for the Client _NOT THE SERVER_**

You can get the production-ready static files by using the following command:

```sh
yarn build
```

> These static files will be build and put into the **/build** directory.

## Ohara manager image

Run the following command to get the production ready build of both **Server** and **Client**. This command will only install **production needed dependencies**.

```sh
yarn setup:prod
```

After the build, copy/use these files and directories to the destination directory

- index.js
- package.json
- client -- only node_modules and build directories are needed
  - node_modules
  - build
- constants
- node_modules
- routes
- utils

**From the Ohara manager project root**, use the following command to start the manager:

```sh
CONFIGURATOR_API=http://hostname:port/v0 yarn start
```

If you have forever installed on your machine globally with npm, you can then check the server logs with:

```sh
forever logs -f 0
```

> Here the 0 means the process index

Use forever to see the running processes:

```sh
forever listall
```

Or stop them

```sh
forever stopall
```

For more info, check out the forever [docs](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever)

## CI server integration

In order to work with Graddle on Jenkins, Ohara manager provides a few npm scripts as the following:

Run tests on CI:

```sh
yarn test:ci
```

- Run all tests including **Server** and **Client** unit tests as well as **Client** End-to-End tests. The test reports can be found in `ohara-manager/test-reports/`

- This npm script will also run `yarn setup` to ensure that all necessary packages are correctly installed prior to running tests.

Clean `test-reports/` on the **Server**, `node_moduels/` on both **Server** and **Client** directories:

```sh
yarn clean
```

Clean all running processes started with node.js

```sh
yarn clean:process
```

This is useful when you want to kill all node.js processes, alternatively, use `pkill node` or simply `kill -9 ${PID}` to stop process

## Prepush

We also provide a npm script to run all the tests(both client and server unit tests and e2e tests) lint, and format all the JS files with:

```sh
yarn prepush
```

## Having issues?

- **Got an error while starting up the server: Error: Cannot find module ${module-name}**

  If you're running into this, it's probably that this module is not correctly installed on your machine. You can fix this by simply run:

  ```sh
   yarn # If this doesn't work, try `yarn add ${module-name}`
  ```

After the installation is completed, start the server again.

- **Got an error while starting up the server or client on a Linux machine: ENOSPC**

  You can run this command to increase the limit on the number of files Linux will watch. Read more [here](https://github.com/guard/listen/wiki/Increasing-the-amount-of-inotify-watchers#the-technical-details).

  ```sh
  echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p.
  ```

- **Node.js processes cannot be stopped even after using kill -9**

  We're using `forever` to start our node.js servers on CI, and `nodemon` while in development, so you need to use the following commands to kill them. `kill -9` or `fuser` might not work as you expected.

  use `yarn clean:process` command or `pkill node` to kill all the node.js processes
