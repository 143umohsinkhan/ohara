Documentation
=============

OharaStream is open to users, developers and man living in earth. Hence, we prepare a bunch of docs to help you to
understand ohara comprehensively but quickly.


For user
--------

This section is for the ohara users who are going to install and then test official streaming application. For this case,
you don't need to compile, build or write anything for ohara. All you have to read the `User Guide`_
and then follow the advice of `installation section`_.

.. _User Guide: user_guide.html
.. _installation section: user_guide.html#installation


For Developer
-------------

If you want to know how to build ohara, please read: `how to build`_

Apart from contributing code to ohara, you can also leverage ohara to design your `custom connector`_,
`custom streamapp` or build your UI interface via `Ohara REST interface`_.

.. _custom connector: custom_connector.html
