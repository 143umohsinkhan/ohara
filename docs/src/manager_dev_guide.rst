Ohara Manager Development Guideline
===================================

This module contains Ohara manager (an HTTP server powered by
`Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/>`__) and Ohara manager client (A
web-based user interface built with `React.js <https://reactjs.org/>`__
). In the following docs, we refer to **Server** as Ohara manager and
**Client** as Ohara manager client.

.. _managerdev-initial-setup:

Initial machine setup
---------------------

1. Install `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/>`__ 10.16.3 or node.js >=10.16.3 and < 11.0.0

2. Install `Yarn <https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable>`__
   1.13.0 or greater

3. Make sure youâ€™re in the ohara-manager root and use this command to
   setup the app: ``yarn setup``. This will install all the dependencies
   for both the **Server** and **Client** as well as creating a
   production build for the client.

4. **Optional**: If youâ€™re using Visual Studio Code as your editor, have
   a look at our :ref:`Editors <managerdev-editors>` section.

.. _managerdev-mac:

Mac
^^^

Make sure you have ``watchman`` installed on your machine. You can do
this with homebrew:

.. code:: sh

   brew install watchman

Linux
^^^^^

Install these dependencies for cypress:

.. code:: sh

   yum install -y xorg-x11-server-Xvfb gtk2-2.24* libXtst* libXScrnSaver* GConf2* alsa-lib*

..

   Have issues while setting up? Try the :ref:`Having issues <managerdev-having-issues>` section to troubleshoot.

Development
-----------

.. note::
  If this is your first time running this project, you need to complete
  the :ref:`Initial machine setup <managerdev-initial-setup>` section above ðŸ‘†

Quick start guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Make sure youâ€™re at the Ohara manager root, then start it with:

  .. code:: sh

    yarn start --configurator http://host:port/v0

  ..

     Note that the configurator option is required, and you should have
     configurator running before starting Ohara manager. You can see the
     :ref:`user guide <userguide>` on how to spin up a configurator


  Open another terminal tab, and start the **Client**:

  ::

     yarn start:client

  Now, go to http://localhost:3000 and start your development, happy
  hacking ðŸ˜Ž

Full development guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In development, you need to start both the **Ohara manager** and **Ohara
manager client** servers before you can start your development. Follow
the instructions below:

Server:

  Make sure youâ€™re at the ohara-manager root:

  .. code:: sh

     yarn start --configurator http://host:port/v0

  .. note::
    Note that the ``--configurator`` argument is required, you should
    pass in Ohara configurator API URL.

  You can also override the default port ``5050`` by passing in ``--port``
  like the following:

  .. code:: sh

    yarn start --configurator http://host:port/v0 --port 1234

  After starting the server, visit ``http://localhost:${PORT}`` in your
  browser.

  Double check the configurator spelling and API URL, the URL should
  contain the API version number: ``/v0``

Client:

  Start the **Client** development server with:

  .. code:: sh

    yarn start:client

  After starting the dev server, visit ``http://localhost:3000`` in your browser and start you development.

  You can override the default port ``3000`` by passing in an environment variable:

  .. code:: sh

    PORT=7777 yarn start:client

  The dev server will then start at ``http://localhost:7777``

Test
^^^^

You can run both the **Server** and **Client** unit tests with a single
npm script:

.. code:: sh

   yarn test

You can also run them separately as:

Server:

  Make sure youâ€™re in the ohara-manager root, and use the following commands:

  Run the test and stay in Jest watch mode

  .. code:: sh

    yarn test:watch

  Generate a test coverage report
  The coverage reports can be found in ``ohara-manager/coverage/``

  .. code:: sh

    yarn test:coverage

Client:

  Run the tests and stay in Jestâ€™s watch mode

  .. code:: sh

    yarn test:client

  Generate test coverage reports
  The coverage reports can be found in ``ohara-manager/client/coverage/``

  .. code:: sh

    yarn test:client:coverage

  We also have a npm script that runs both the **client** server and unit tests together:

  .. code:: sh

    yarn dev:client

  **Client** also has End-to-End tests, you can run them via the following command:

  .. code:: sh

    yarn test:e2e:open

  This will open cypress test runner, you can then run your test manually through the UIs.

Linting
^^^^^^^

  We use `ESLint <https://github.com/eslint/eslint>`__ to lint all the JavaScript:

  Server:

    .. code:: sh

      yarn lint:server

    Itâ€™s usually helpful to run linting while developing and thatâ€™s included in ``yarn start`` command:

    .. code:: sh

      yarn start --configurator http://host:port/v0

    This will start the server with ``nodemon`` and run the linting script whenever nodemon reloads.

  Client:

    Since our client is bootstrapped with create-react-app, so the linting
    part is already taken care. When starting the **Client** dev server with
    ``yarn start:client``, the linting will be starting automatically.

    Note that due to create-react-app doesnâ€™t support custom eslint rules.
    You need to use your text editor plugin to display the custom linting
    rule warnings or errors. For more info about this, please take a look at
    the create-react-app
    `docs <https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/setting-up-your-editor#displaying-lint-output-in-the-editor>`__


Format
^^^^^^

  We use `Prettier <https://github.com/prettier/prettier>`__ to format our
  code. You can format all ``.js`` files with:

  .. code:: sh

    yarn format

  - You can ignore files or folders when running ``yarn format`` by
    editing the ``.prettierignore`` in the Ohara-manager root.

  .. note::
   Note that ``node_modules`` is ignore by default so you donâ€™t need to
   add that in the ``.prettierignore``


Build
^^^^^

  **Note that this step is only required for the Client NOT THE SERVER**

  You can get production-ready static files by using the following command:

  .. code:: sh

     yarn build

  .. note::
     These static files will be built and put into the **/ohara-manager/client/build** directory.


Ohara manager image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Run the following command to get the production ready build of both the
  **Server** and **Client**.

  .. code:: sh

    yarn setup

  After the build, copy/use these files and directories to the destination
  directory (Note this step is automatically done by Ohara-assembly
  module):

  -  start.js
  -  config.js
  -  client â€“ only build directory is needed

     -  build

  -  constants
  -  node_modules
  -  routes
  -  utils

  .. note::
     Note that if you add new files or dirs to the **Server** or
     **Client** and these files and dirs are required for production
     build, please list that file in the above list as well as editing the
     gradle file under ``ohara/ohara-assembly/build.gradle``. **Skipping
     this step will cause production build failed!**

  **From the Ohara manager project root**, use the following command to
  start the manager:

  .. code:: sh

    yarn start:prod --configurator http://host:port/v0


CI server integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  In order to work with Graddle on Jenkins, Ohara manager provides a few
  npm scripts as the following:

  Run tests on CI:

  .. code:: sh

    yarn test

  -  Run all tests including the **Server** and the **Client** unit tests.
     The test reports can be found in ``ohara-manager/test-reports/``

  -  Note you should run ``yarn setup`` to ensure that all necessary
     packages are installed prior to running tests.


Clean
^^^^^

  Clean up all running processes, removing ``test-reports/`` in the
  **Server** and ``/build`` directory in the **Client**:

  .. code:: sh

    yarn clean

  Clean all running processes started with node.js

  .. code:: sh

    yarn clean:process

  This is useful when you want to kill all node.js processes

Prepush
^^^^^^^

  We also provide a npm script to run all the tests (both client and
  server unit tests and e2e tests) lint, and format all the JS files with.
  **Ideally, youâ€™d run this before pushing your code to the remote repo:**

  .. code:: sh

    yarn prepush

.. _managerdev-editors:

Editors
-------

  We highly recommend that you use `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__ (or vscode for short) to edit
  and author Ohara manager code.

  **Recommend vscode settings**

  .. code:: json

     {
       "editor.tabSize": 2,
       "editor.formatOnSave": true,
       "editor.formatOnSaveTimeout": 2000,
       "editor.tabCompletion": true,
       "emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab": true,
       "emmet.includeLanguages": {
         "javascript": "javascriptreact",
         "markdown": "html"
       },
       "search.exclude": {
         "**/node_modules": true,
         "**/bower_components": true,
         "**/coverage": true
       },
       "prettier.eslintIntegration": true,
       "javascript.updateImportsOnFileMove.enabled": "always"
     }

  **Recommend extensions**

  -  `ESLint <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint>`__
     - install this so vscode can display linting errors right in the
     editor

     - ``.env`` file syntax highlighting support
  -  `Color
     Highlight <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight>`__
     - Highlight web colors in VSCode


Switch different version of Node.js
-----------------------------------

  Oftentimes you would need to switch between different Node.js versions
  for debugging. Thereâ€™s a handy npm package that can reduce the pain of
  managing different version of Node.js on your machine:

  First, letâ€™s install this package ``n``

  .. code:: sh

     # install this globally so it's can be used through out all your projects
     npm install -g n # or yarn global add n

  Second, letâ€™s use ``n`` to install a specific version of Node.js:

  .. code:: sh

    n 8.16.0

  .. note::
     After the specific version is installed, ``n`` will switch your
     active Node.js version to it

  You can switch between versions that you have previously installed on
  your machine with ``n``, an interactive prompt will be displayed and you
  can easily choose a Node.js version form it

  .. code:: sh

    n # Yep, just type n in your terminal...,

  For more info, you can read the `docs <https://github.com/tj/n>`__ here.

.. _managerdev-having-issues:

Having issues?
--------------

  -  **Got an error while starting up the server: Error: Cannot find module ${module-name}**

     If youâ€™re running into this, itâ€™s probably that this module is not
     correctly installed on your machine. You can fix this by simply run:

     .. code:: sh

         yarn # If this doesn't work, try `yarn add ${module-name}`

     After the installation is completed, start the server again.

  -  **Got an error while starting up the server or client on a Linux machine: ENOSPC**

     You can run this command to increase the limit on the number of files
     Linux will watch. Read more
     `here <https://github.com/guard/listen/wiki/Increasing-the-amount-of-inotify-watchers#the-technical-details>`__.

     .. code:: sh

        echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p.

  -  **Node.js processes cannot be stopped even after using kill -9**

     Weâ€™re using ``forever`` to start our node.js servers on CI, and
     ``nodemon`` while in development, so you need to use the following
     commands to kill them. ``kill -9`` or ``fuser`` might not work as you
     expected.

     use ``yarn clean:processes`` command or ``pkill node`` to kill all the node.js processes

  -  **While running test in jestâ€™s watch modal, an error is thrown**

     ::

        Error watching file for changes: EMFILE

     Try installing ``watchman`` for your mac with the :ref:`instruction <managerdev-mac>`

     For more info: https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/1767

  -  **Ohara manager is not able to connect to Configurator**

     And Iâ€™m seeing something like:

     ::

        --configurator: we're not able to connect to http://host:port/v0

        Please make sure your Configurator is running at http://host:port/v0

        [nodemon] app crashed - waiting for file changes before starting...

     This could happen due to several factors:

     -  **Configurator hasnâ€™t fully started yet**: after you start the
        configurator container. The container needs some time to fully
        initialize the service. This usually takes about a minute or so.
        And as weâ€™re doing the API check by hitting the real API in Ohara
        manager. This results to the error in the above.

     -  **Youâ€™re not using the correct IP in Manager container**: if you
        start a configurator container in your local as well as a manager.
        You should specify an IP instead of something like localhost in:
        â€“configurator http://localhost:12345/v0 This wonâ€™t work as the
        manager is started in the container so it wonâ€™t be able to connect
        to the configurator without a real IP

     -  **As we mentioned in the previous sections. Please double check
        your configurator URL spelling. This is usually the cause of the
        above-mentioned error**
