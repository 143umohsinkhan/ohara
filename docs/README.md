understand ohara comprehensively but quickly.

## for user

This section is for the ohara users who are going to install and then test official streaming application. For this case,
you don't need to compile, build or write anything for ohara. All you have to read the [User Guide](user_guide.md)
and then follow the advice of [installation section](user_guide.md#installation).
